## awesome-languages
A curated list of awesome (IMHO) programming languages (with an open-source implementation)
> This list sucks :cold_sweat:. Help me !

### the known ones :bowtie:
* [Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby)
* [PHP](https://github.com/php/php-src)
* [Javascript (V8 Implementation)](https://github.com/v8/v8-git-mirror)
* Objective-C (Clang/LLVM)
* NOT AWESOME : 
  * C : because it lacks soooo many things
  * C++ : unsafe, no memory management (let's reinvent the wheel), steep learning curve
  * C# : Only Windows, too slow

### the less known ones :yum:
